In three different windows:

1)
while True:
		for i in range(get_world_size()):
				if  get_entity_type() == Entities.Dead_Pumpkin:
  				harvest()
  				plant(Entities.Pumpkin)
  				move(North)
				if get_entity_type() == Entities.Pumpkin:
	  			move(North)
				else:
  				harvest()
          till() //once the grond is 100% covered with Grounds.soil, then remove till()
  				plant(Entities.Pumpkin)
  				move(North)
				
  	move(East)
					
2)
harvest()

//I have not figured out that the drone determines between 1 large pumpkin in range(get_world_size()) vs. small pumpkins in the row
